# to use partitioned MSAs, provide a link to the partition file for each MSA,
# the first in RAxML-NG compatible format, the second in IQ-Tree compatible format
# note that the MSA features will be computed for the entire alignment
# In this case, the msa_paths list should be a list of lists:
# msa_paths: [
#    [/path/to/msa1, /path/to/msa1.part.ng, /path/to/msa1.part.iqt],
#    /path/to/msa2, /path/to/msa2.part.ng, /path/to/msa2.part.iqt],
#    ...
# ]

# After running the pipeline, the outdir will contain a subdirectory for each given MSA
# each subdirectory contains:
# - a directory called "output_files": contains all RAxML-NG and IQ-Tree log files
# - an .sqlite3 database file containing all information, see README.md for database schema
